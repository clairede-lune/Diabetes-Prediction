## Diabetes Prediction Model using Gradient Boosting

### Overview

This project aims to predict whether a patient has diabetes using the Gradient Boosting algorithm, a powerful and robust ensemble learning technique. The model is trained and evaluated on four different datasets to ensure robustness and generalizability.

### Datasets

#### Dataset 1
- **About**: This dataset pertains to diabetes prediction, focusing on healthcare assessments. It includes various health indicators.
- **Features**: Gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c level, blood glucose level, Outcome.
- **Importance of Features**: 
  - **Gender and Age**: Provide demographic insights.
  - **Hypertension, Heart Disease, and Smoking History**: Offer critical health context.
  - **BMI**: Indicates weight-related factors.
  - **HbA1c and Blood Glucose Levels**: Offer precise measures of glycemic control.
  - **Outcome**: Represents the likelihood of developing diabetes.

#### Dataset 2
- **About**: This dataset focuses on diabetes prediction for health assessments. It includes medical and demographic features.
- **Features**: Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age, Outcome.
- **Importance of Features**: 
  - **Pregnancies**: May indicate gestational diabetes risk.
  - **Glucose Levels**: Primary diagnostic criterion.
  - **Blood Pressure**: Insights into cardiovascular health.
  - **Skin Thickness and Insulin Levels**: Contribute to overall risk assessment.
  - **BMI**: Indicates weight-related factors.
  - **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Assesses hereditary risk.
  - **Age**: Provides demographic insights.
  - **Outcome**: Represents the likelihood of developing diabetes.

#### Dataset 3
- **About**: This dataset is centered around health assessments for predicting diabetes.
- **Features**: Outcome, HighBP, HighChol, CholCheck, BMI, Smoker, Stroke, HeartDiseaseorAttack, PhysActivity, Fruits, Veggies, HvyAlcoholConsump, AnyhealthCare, NoDocbcCost, GenHlth, MentHlth, PhysHlth, DiffWalk, Sex, Age, Education, Income.
- **Importance of Features**: 
  - **HighBP and HighChol**: Indicate hypertension and high cholesterol.
  - **BMI**: Reflects body mass index and weight-related health risks.
  - **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, and physical activity offer insights into behavior-associated health risks.
  - **Demographic Context**: Age and education levels.
  - **Income**: Indicates socio-economic influences on overall health.
  - **Outcome**: Represents the likelihood of developing diabetes.

#### Dataset 4
- **About**: This dataset focuses on health assessments to predict diabetes.
- **Features**: Outcome, HighBP, HighChol, CholCheck, BMI, Smoker, Stroke, HeartDiseaseorAttack, PhysActivity, Fruits, Veggies, HvyAlcoholConsump, AnyhealthCare, NoDocbcCost, GenHlth, MentHlth, PhysHlth, DiffWalk, Sex, Age, Education, Income.
- **Importance of Features**: 
  - **HighBP and HighChol**: Indicators of hypertension and high cholesterol.
  - **BMI**: Fundamental in understanding weight-related health risks.
  - **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, and physical activity provide insights into behavior-linked health hazards.
  - **Demographic Context**: Age and education levels.
  - **Income**: Socio-economic influences on overall health.
  - **Outcome**: Represents the likelihood of developing diabetes.

### Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

You can install the necessary packages using the following command:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

### Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and preprocess the data. This involves handling missing values, normalizing the features, and consolidating data from the four datasets.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Train the Gradient Boosting model. The script splits each dataset into training and testing sets, trains the model on the training sets, and saves the trained model.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance. The script loads the saved model and evaluates it on the test sets, providing various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Jupyter Notebook**:
   - For an interactive approach, you can explore the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance using the provided Jupyter notebook.

### Results

The model achieves high accuracy across the four datasets. Detailed performance metrics are available in the evaluation script output.
